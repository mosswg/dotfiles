# dotfiles

My these are my personal dot files. I currently use [arch linux](https://archlinux.org) with [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), [gBar](https://github.com/scorpion-26/gBar), [neovim](https://neovim.io/), and [doom emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs). These are mostly my own configs but the base and the rofi utils I use are from [this](https://github.com/d4r1us-drk/dotfiles) awesome repo by [d4r1us-drk](https://github.com/d4r1us-drk).
